# CS101 2023Fall 算法与数据结构
CS101 introduces some algorithms and data structures. Attendees would learn about how to design and analyse algorithms. For algorithms and data structures, the main content are as below:
- **Data Structures**: linked list, stack, queue.
- **Sort**: merge sort, heap sort, quick sort.
- **Hash**: hash function and hash table.
- **Tree**: binary search tree, AVL tree, disjoint set.
- **Graph Algorithm**: BFS, DFS, topological sort, minimum spanning tree, shortest path.
- **Advanced Algorithm**: divide and conquer, dynamic programming, P and NP.

**This repository contains**:
- The course slides.
- The questions and keys to homeworks, quizzes and examinations.
- The description, my own solution and some reference solution for the programming assignmets.
